# test-data-generator-v3 This is a tkinter based regex test generator. Currently, it will understand \d, \w, and * commands, as well as [] and {}. Check the test_copy for an example of the structure and the capabilites of the test data generator. To start it, load this code into a python venv and run the run.py script. This should open a pop-up where the user can choose the input JSON document, the output folder(where the output should go),and the name of the resulting file and logs. Click generate data an there should be a screen that will say "Script executed successfully!"
